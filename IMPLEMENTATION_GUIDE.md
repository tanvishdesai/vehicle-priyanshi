## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Google Gemini Integration:
- **Model**: `gemini-pro` (most widely available model)
  - Alternative models: `gemini-1.5-pro`, `gemini-1.5-flash`
  - Change the model in `convex/reports.ts` line 138 if needed
- **Prompt Engineering**: Comprehensive prompts that include all appointment details
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages if API fails
- **Database Storage**: All reports are saved for future reference
- **Markdown Rendering**: AI reports are rendered with proper markdown formatting using react-markdown

**Note**: If you get model errors, try changing the model name to one of these:
- `gemini-pro` (recommended, most compatible)
- `gemini-1.5-pro` (newer, may require specific API access)
- `gemini-1.5-flash` (fastest, may require specific API access)

### Database Schema Updates:
```typescript
serviceReports: {
  // ... existing fields
  aiGeneratedReport: v.optional(v.string()),  // NEW: AI-generated report content
  generatedAt: v.optional(v.number()),        // NEW: Timestamp of generation
}
```

### Key Functions:
- `generateAIServiceReport` (action) - Calls Gemini API to generate report
- `createAIServiceReport` (mutation) - Saves the generated report to database
- `getReportByAppointment` (query) - Retrieves report for specific appointment
